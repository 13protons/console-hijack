# Streams
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alanguir/streams.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alanguir/streams)

Implementing the [Nodejs Stream API](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) for the browser. The goal of this work is for easy future interoperability between browser based clients and Node based servers, with a specific focus on supporting many different protocols to bridge between a browser stream and server stream.

## Installation
