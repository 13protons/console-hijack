    <h1>Stream as Debouncer</h1>
    <h2>Open your console to see the action :)</h2>
    <p>In this example, a post request has been modeled as a stream. A random fragment of a poem is written to the steam</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // By the Stream by Paul Laurence Dunbar, 1872 - 1906
      // http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/stream
      var words = "By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass, How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass, And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads, Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads. And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go, For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show, And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries, When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.".split(' ');

      // writeable callback function performs expensive opperation - post to API
      var writeable = Stream.writeable(function (data){
        return $.post('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {phrases: data})
      });

      // Comment out this line to reduce console noise
      writeable._loglevel('info');

      writeable.cork();

      writeable.on('drain', function(data){
        console.log(Date.now(), 'Saving buffered data.', data);
      })

      addToStreamAfterInterval(); // infinite recursion for life of page

      setInterval(function(){
        console.info('=======================');
        writeable.uncork();
        setTimeout(writeable.cork);
      }, 5 * 1000) // every 5 seconds;

      function addToStreamAfterInterval() {
        var start = random(words.length);
        var end = start + random(words.length - start);

        var fragment = words.slice(start, end);

        // Write that data to stream!
        writeable.write(fragment.join(' '));

        setTimeout(addToStreamAfterRandomInterval, 750);

        function random(gamut) {
          return Math.floor(Math.random() * gamut);
