    <h1>Model the console as a Stream</h1>
    <h2>Open your console to see the action :)</h2>
    <p>In this example, the console object has been turned into a writeable stream. The stream's buffer capacity has been set low to illustrate backpressue. One word of a poem is written to the stream at a time, and backpressue triggeres a buffer flush and pauses streaming until the stream is ready to recieve more data. </p>

      // By the Stream by Paul Laurence Dunbar, 1872 - 1906

      var words = "By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass, How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass, And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads, Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads. And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go, For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show, And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries, When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.".split(' ');
